FieldTrip.it README
===================

Welcome to the app! Clone locally and run `bundle install && rake db:create db:schema:load` to get started. This assumes you have all components to run a rails app out of the box. If this is not the case then visiting http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/ may be helpful.
